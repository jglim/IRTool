# IRTool

![IR Demo](https://raw.github.com/jglim/IRTool/master/resources/irtool-demo.gif)

Use your Gameboy Color to control *National* air-conditioners!

Build with [GBDK-N](https://github.com/andreasjhkarlsson/gbdk-n) (normal GBDK will not work).

Also, use [ihx2gb.js](https://github.com/DonaldHays/bubblefactory/tree/master/ihx2gb) to rebuild the ROM to enable GBC support using the `--cgb 192` flag.

The precompiled GBC ROM can be found in the repository as `main.gb`.

A writeup on this tool is also available [here](http://jg.sn.sg/ir/).
